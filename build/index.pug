						h1 A-Frame makes it easy to build 3D web experiences
					section.vertical-slide
						p Created by Mozilla at the end of 2015
						p.fragment Open-source, version 0.5.0 as of June 2017.
						p.fragment Focused on creating virtual reality experiences, already being used for more.

						h1 How it works
					section.vertical-slide
						h1 HTML5 Custom entities (polyfilled)
						p.fragment Allow you to write HTML-like syntax for 3D objects on the web.
						p.fragment Can use stadard DOM selection APIs to manipulate 3D objects!
						p.fragment Set attributes on your A-Frame entities to manipulate them with JavaScript.
						//- code example from one a-entity
					section.vertical-slide
						h1 A layer of abstraction over three.js
						p.fragment Instead of writing an enormous amount of three.js boilerplate, A-Frame's HTML-like syntax makes it a breeze to build.
					section.vertical-slide
						h1 Everything kept in memory
						p JavaScript is pretty fast - but writing to the DOM is slow. 
						p.fragment A-Frame keeps its changes in memory to avoid the performance hit of writing to the DOM.
						p.fragment But that means you won't see any changes in the DOM ðŸ˜¬.
						p.fragment Luckily it comes with...
					section.vertical-slide
						h1 The visual inspector
						p.fragment Unless you're strong at calculus - which is not me -- placing objects in 3D space is a challenge!
						p.fragment A-Frame's visual inspector is a great way to position objects in 3D space, alter attributes and just get in and get messy.

					h1 A-Frame is what I love about the web:
					section.vertical-slide
						h3 Low cost of entry
						p Unity vs. Unreal vs. a web framework with a syntax like HTML?
						p.fragment I'll take the web framework any day.
						p.fragment Easy to launch, easy to iterate.
