Slide notes:

** A-Frame takes the pain 
- 3D development is _hard_ and A-Frame makes it easier.

**VR/AR/MR (second slide)

virtual reality - headset, `step into a new reality` 
augmented reality - device acts as a portal into a new reality (pokemon go)
mixed reality - both; headset allows you to see and interact with 3d objects around you

**enter the web

- WebGL 1 enabled on all major browsers (let's throw the caniuse in there)
- WebGL 2/WebAss are on Chrome and FF.

**A-Frame facts
- Zip through this (and make changes so that the only fragments are the list items)


** A-Frame is what I love about the web
